# My init.vim

This is my personal init.vim for neovim. There isn't much of interest here, but
take what you wish.

## Setup

You'll first need to install [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
by following the instructions from that repository.

Now clone this git repository to `~/.config/nvim`.

```
mkdir -p ~/.config
git clone https://github.com/d11wtq/init.vim ~/.config/nvim
```

Launch nvim and run `:PlugInstall`. You shoud be good to go.
